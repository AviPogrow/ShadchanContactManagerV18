Learning is important to her but she would be fine with short term or part time learning. Not specifically looking for college but wants to be financially secure. She needs a good solid boy from a similar background - easy going but responsible.	She went thru the Bais Yaakov system and then to Bnos Chayim Seminary in Lakewood. She is a good frum solid girl with Bais Yaakov Hashkofos. She is warm and friendly and outgoing. Many of her siblings are yeshivish/ baalibatish and some chasidish leaning. She is ready to work and she is very successful in every job that she has had.	Zidele	Yehudis	yzidele@kof-k.org	2019513407
